# Project Overview

## Task Description

You have a server which returns random numbers via WebSocket ([socket.io](https://socket.io)) connection.

You should implement the next:

1. A line chart:
   - **x-axis**: time of a received number (look at `timestamp` payload field)
   - **y-axis**: number values
2. A bar chart:
   - **x-axis**: range categories (e.g. `-10 - 0`, `0 - 10`, `10 - 20` etc)
   - **y-axis**: the amount of numbers in each category
3. (Optional) An input called _"Alert threshold"_:
   - a user should be able to enter a number
   - if the random number received from the server is greater than the threshold - show an alert toast / snackbar with the number as the payload
4. Design: we appreciate your own design decisions =)

Charts should be updated in real time. **Please**, consider code style best practices.

## Limitations

1. **React**
2. Use [socket.io-client](https://socket.io/docs/client-api) to connect to the server
3. That‚Äôs all
